==============

This is a library of functions that can be used to read native TransCAD files
directly into R without intermediate conversion to `.csv` or `.dbf`. I am 
currently working on reading binary data tables, but hope to extend the package
to cover zonal data and networks in the future.

This package is under active development, and any contribution is welcome.
